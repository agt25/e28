## Outside resources

### Lounge Page

1. The text part of the logo that says ‘Cafe’ is from [404 Neon Text by Bluehaus](https://codepen.io/Bluehaus/pen/bZkZom)

2. The range sliders were modified from [Ana Tudor's CodePen](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/pvLPOQ)

3. Slight self-pat on my cafe's nav*bar*. I wish I had an island like it. I made it by taking a picture of a bed headboard from Restoration Hardware’s site (free HD!) and adding a marble slab atop. If anyone ever runs out of realistic free image sources, check out furniture sites! I can't believe I hadn't thought of it 'till now!


### Likes Page

1. The header that says ‘likes’ is from Matthew Wilber’s CodePen [‘Vintage Button’](https://codepen.io/mwilber/pen/jvZMVb)

2. The header which says music is the same text as on the lounge page —— [404 Neon Text by Bluehaus](https://codepen.io/Bluehaus/pen/bZkZom)


PS, tracks and sound-effects are hosted on Amazon S3 buckets. 


### Notes for instructor
About a week ago, I tried to build somewhat of an educational TikTok clone. I thought I’d be able to — despite having another project, a 7-page paper, and a database pset due within that week. Needless to say, I did not succeed at getting the backend running with Firebase. I also briefly tried Django but had overestimated my knowledge within — thinking I’d be able to learn REST in a day. So thank you for building an API for us (that I should’ve used from the get-go!). It’s amazing! You make it look so easy!

And most importantly, thank you so much for your extension policy. I had a ton of anxiety taking my first! But it allowed me to mess up, experiment, and learn all the better without the fear of a pending deadline. I think your policy is wonderful. I can only wish that other professors implement something like it! So, I bow down to you! Thank you for thinking ahead for your students and making everything a little better for me at a week when I was ready to drop out from the stress and deadlines! I'm also truly sorry for taking the full week. I had a lot of fun with this project and kept adding  to it :)
